## Writing the prompt

When spawning an agent (with a subagent_type), it starts with zero context.
Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

Terse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.

  const currentExamples = `Example usage:

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: I'm going to use the ${FILE_WRITE_TOOL_NAME} tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests
</commentary>
assistant: Uses the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool to launch a test-runner agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool to launch the greeting-responder agent"
</example>

The ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

When using the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.`

When NOT to use the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the ${FILE_READ_TOOL_NAME} tool or ${GLOB_TOOL_NAME} instead of the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use ${GREP_TOOL_NAME} instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the ${FILE_READ_TOOL_NAME} tool instead of the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above
`

  // Non-coordinator gets the full prompt with all sections
  return `${shared}
${whenNotToUseSection}

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} with the agent's ID or name as the \`to\` field. The agent resumes with its full context preserved. Each Agent invocation starts fresh — provide a complete task description.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool use content blocks.
- You can optionally set \`isolation: "worktree"\` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.${writingThePromptSection}
